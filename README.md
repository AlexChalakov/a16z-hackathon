# **a16z & Mistral Hackathon - AI Mind Companion**

This project leverages **Mistral AI** models to create an interactive emotional AI companion, aimed at supporting the elderly and those with memory challenges. The AI Companion uses the **Pixtral-12B** model to process chat-based queries and image-based descriptions. Additionally, we have integrated a **Telegram Bot** for easy and personalized interactions.

We have also fine-tuned **Mistral Large** using the [Empathetic Dialogues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmpatheticDialogues) dataset to create a more empathetic conversational agent (API fine-tuning for **Pixtral-12B** is not yet available).

## **Features**

- **Text-Based Chat**: Interact with the AI using natural language. The bot is designed to provide empathetic and context-aware responses to support users.
- **Image Analysis**: Get AI-powered descriptions of images. The bot can analyze photos, such as old family pictures, to provide descriptive and emotional insight.
- **Memory Integration**: The bot maintains an ongoing conversation history, allowing for more personalized interactions.
- **Telegram Bot**: The AI Mind Companion is also available as a Telegram bot for easy access and direct conversations on any device. The bot can handle both text and images seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Name & Background Setting**: Users can dynamically set their name and provide additional background information to make responses more personalized.
- **Voice Interaction**: Voice-to-text functionality is available for text-based interactions through the terminal, providing enhanced accessibility.

## **Setup Instructions**
