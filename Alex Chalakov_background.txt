Alex Chalakov is a 78-year-old retired schoolteacher, originally from Manchester but now residing in London. After teaching history at a local high school for over 35 years, Alex retired in 2010 to spend more time with his family and pursue his passion for gardening and woodworking. Alex's wife, Margaret, passed away in 2015 after a long battle with Alzheimer's, which deeply affected Alex. He often reminisces about their trips to the Lake District and how they spent their summers hiking and reading by the fire. Alex has three children: Michael, his eldest son, is a software engineer living in Edinburgh; Laura, his only daughter, works as a nurse in Bristol; and his youngest, David, is a journalist in New York. Alex takes great pride in his five grandchildren, who visit him regularly during the holidays. Emily, the eldest, is 12 and has recently taken up ballet, something Alex finds particularly exciting as it reminds him of Margaret, who once dreamed of being a dancer. Oliver, who is 10, shares Alex’s love for gardening, and they often spend weekends planting vegetables and flowers together in the small garden behind Alex's house. Since his retirement, Alex has developed several health issues, including type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. He is on a strict medication regimen to manage his conditions. Every morning, he takes 100mg of Metformin to control his blood sugar levels, followed by 75mg of Aspirin to prevent blood clots. In the evening, he takes Atorvastatin 20mg to manage his cholesterol, along with Lisinopril 10mg to regulate his blood pressure. Recently, Alex’s doctor also prescribed Glimepiride 2mg to be taken with breakfast, which helps boost his insulin production. Alex stays active by taking regular walks in the nearby park. He enjoys birdwatching, a hobby he picked up from his father, who was an ornithologist. Every Sunday, Alex has a standing video call with his children, where they catch up on the week's events. Despite being a bit forgetful at times, Alex is still sharp and witty. However, he occasionally struggles to remember recent conversations, and his family worries that he might be developing early-stage dementia. In his free time, Alex writes letters to his grandchildren, documenting stories from his childhood and adventures during his teaching years. He hopes that one day, they will read these letters and learn more about his life and the values he holds dear. Alex’s daily routine is fairly structured. He wakes up at 6:30 AM, has a light breakfast (usually oatmeal or whole-grain toast), and takes his medications. After breakfast, he spends an hour reading the newspaper or one of the history books he loves so much. His afternoons are dedicated to gardening or woodworking in his shed, where he is currently building a birdhouse for Emily. Alex finds great peace in working with his hands, a passion that has kept him busy in his retirement years. Although Alex misses his wife dearly, he finds solace in his family and the memories they’ve created together. He enjoys visits from his grandchildren, particularly during Christmas, when the entire family gathers at his house for a big meal. His daughter Laura often stays a few extra days to help him around the house and make sure he’s taking his medication properly. As Alex grows older, he acknowledges that he needs more help managing his day-to-day tasks, but he is determined to stay independent for as long as possible. His children have suggested getting a personal assistant or using a digital companion to remind him of important appointments, but Alex is still adjusting to the idea. For now, he prefers relying on his own memory, occasional notes, and the gentle reminders from his family
